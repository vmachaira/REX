# REX Model
This is a non-FIFO realistic time-dependent model for Multimodal Public transit, called non-FIFO time-dependent model with REalistic eXchange times (REX) along with a novel query algorithm called TRIP-based LAbel-correction propagation (TRIPLA) algorithm that efficiently solves the realistic earliest-arrival routing problem.

The REX model possesses all strong features of previous time-dependent graph models without suffering from their deficiencies. It handles non-negligible exchanges from one vehicle to another, as well as supports non-FIFO instances which are typical in public transport, without compromising space efficiency. We conduct a thorough experimental evaluation with real-world data which demonstrates that TRIPLA significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art query algorithms for
multimodal earliest-arrival routing in schedule-based public transport.
